🏥 Medical Cost Personal Dataset – End-to-End Data Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project performs end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Medical Cost Personal Dataset to understand the key factors influencing insurance charges, such as age, BMI, smoking habits, region, and number of dependents.

The project simulates a real-world healthcare analytics scenario, transforming raw CSV data into meaningful business insights using Python.

It demonstrates practical Data Analyst skills including:

Data cleaning & preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualization

Statistical interpretation

Business recommendations
